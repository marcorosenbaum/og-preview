# og-preview

## Get a preview of all available open graph meta data before deploying your project.

Once the project you are working on is running on the dev server, you can simply get a preview of the og-data by executing the command "og-preview start -p <port>" in the cli.

EXAMPLE: If your project is running on localhost:5173 then you add port 5173. -> "og-preview start -p 5173"

The package will automatically start a new dev server on a free port and open a new tab in the browser with the preview of all available open graph meta data.
